# paper-craft-components

Documentation home for video 20's recurring "paper craft" visual primitives — the small set of drawing functions that reappear across most of its A0/A1-batch shots. `sb_lib.py` and `a0lib.py` are duplicated here verbatim from `../video20-a0-shots/src/` and `../video20-a1-shots/src/` (both already confirmed clean of personal paths) purely so these concepts have one place to be read and pointed at, independent of which shot batch happens to use them at runtime. The copies actually imported by the shots are the ones under the `video20-a{0,1}-shots` folders.

## Function → concept map

**纸条字幕 / paper-strip subtitle**
Static version: `sb_lib.py:subtitle_c()`. Animated "production" version (marker-brush stroke-in + keyword pop): `a0lib.py:strip_geometry()` / `strip_image()` / `strip_state()`.

**关键词弹出 / keyword pop**
`a0lib.py:pop_curve()` (the bounce easing curve) + `sb_lib.py:label()` / `vlabel()` (the pill/tag chip the keyword pops into). Note: this repo's `components/kinetic_keyword.js` is a **different, already-shipped implementation** of the same concept — character-by-character rise + blur + fade, a "tech HUD" visual style, ported from a different source project. The two are not interchangeable; they're different visual languages for the same idea. Neither supersedes the other here.

**步骤条 / step bar**
Static: `sb_lib.py:step_bar()`. Animated: `a0lib.py:step_bar_image()`. Note: `components/chapter_tag.js` also has a segmented-progress-bar mechanic (HUD scanline style vs. this paper-card look) — same "two styles, not merged" relationship as above.

**右下人像框 / bottom-right PiP frame**
Static: `sb_lib.py:pip_crop()` / `pip_card()` / `add_pip()`. Animated (the "whole frame warps into the box" version actually used in the video): `a0lib.py:pip_region()` / `pip_layer()` / `_pip_frame()`. The "eyelid closes" variant is separate, hand-animated logic specific to one shot — see `library/clip-narration-pip/README.md` — not a generic parameter of these functions.

**章节铃 / chapter tag**
`sb_lib.py:chapter_tab()`. Note: `components/chapter_tag.js` is the already-shipped, more complete JS version (different visual style) — same both-exist relationship as above.

## Notes for whoever writes `LIBRARY.md`

These 4 concepts don't have their own `preview.mp4`/`thumb.jpg` here — they're building blocks used throughout many shots, not one isolated moment. Link each row to whichever shot's preview best demonstrates it:

- paper subtitle strip — visible in nearly every shot preview in this library.
- step bar — `library/big-number-stepper/` (镜12).
- PiP frame — `library/clip-narration-pip/` (镜7-9).
- chapter tag — `library/fullscreen-dialog/`, `library/film-lightbox/`, `library/live-selfcheck-redo/`, `library/split-screen-workbench/` (镜13/14/15/16/18) all show the chapter tab.
